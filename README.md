# Moneyball-Meets-AI-python

This project is an application of machine learning in order to create a
real-time predicted win rate between two competitors in a 1v1 game.

You may have been watching a game of sports and, depending on the sport/league, a 
real-time graph of predicted win-rate between teams might occasionally pop up. This 
is achieved through AI. This project is simply that, a real-time win-rate prediction 
using AI coded in python, applied to the Esport of Super Smash Bros Melee. 

The following is a video demonstration of the code in action.

The AI models are trained on publicly-available replay files from tournament matches.
The models are Long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN), created
using the TensorFlow framework, specifically the Keras library.
